# BackloggdListExtractor (Succeeded by my new Firefox extension https://github.com/rnw10va/Unofficial-Backloggd-Extension)
Extracts Backloggd.com lists out of Backloggd.com for use elsewhere. It works on you private lists or any public list.

View a Backloggd.com list's source in your browser and then paste it in the blank line underneath the "backloggdWebPage="""" line of code.

This can be ran in an online interpreter, such as the following: https://www.online-python.com/

I made this so that backloggd lists can be pasted into random selection wheels, such as the following: https://wheelofnames.com/

You may have a couple lines of items at the top or bottom of the output that aren't from your Backloggd list depending on the interpreter you use, they should be fairly obvious to catch with a quick scan. The interpreter website I linked above has a couple blank lines and then a couple terminal output lines that should be ignored when copying or deleted if pasted into somewhere else.
